        <h3>Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is an active volcanic area</strong> located along the southeastern shore of the island of Hawaii. It is 45 miles southwest of the city of Hilo. </li>

            <li>Hawaii Volcanoes National Park sprawls along 333,000 acres. <strong>The park rises from sea level to 13,677 feet</strong>. </li>

            <li>If part of Mauna Loa weren’t underwater, it would be higher than Mount Everest! </li>

            <li>Mauna Loa’s younger sibling, Mount Kīlauea, is also a shield volcano and lies on the southeastern portion of the island. According to vulcanologists, <strong>Kīlauea is the Earth’s most active volcano</strong> and Hawaii’s youngest volcano. </li>

            <li>The park is overflowing with flora and fauna. <strong>There are seven ecological zones across Hawaii Volcanoes National Park</strong>: alpine, subalpine, upland forest, rain forest, mid-elevation woodland, lowland, and seacoast.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Theodore Roosevelt National Park</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>It’s fitting that the only U.S. national park to be named for a person is for Theodore Roosevelt</strong>. Roosevelt was the Roosevelt was the ultimate conservationist. He established the U.S. Forest Service and created five national parks, 150 national forests, 51 federal bird reserves, four national game preserves, and 18 national monuments, totaling more than 230 million acres of protected land.</li>

            <li>It’s a bit ironic that Roosevelt first traveled to the Dakota Territory to hunt bison in 1883, then provided protection to save them. A symbol of the West, American bison are regularly spotted combing the park’s grasslands. Set by park managers, the bison herds in Theodore Roosevelt National Park are kept to between 200 to 400 animals for the South Unit and 100 to 300 for the North Unit.1 In addition to bison, the park is home to elk, wild horses, mule and white-tailed deer, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, badgers, porcupines, and prairie dogs.</li>

            <li>Most of the park’s birds are migratory, passing through the park from spring through fall. This includes white-throated sparrows, sandhill cranes, warblers, and swallows. But some birds have adapted and become full-time residents. Bring binoculars and you may spot golden eagles, wild turkeys, black-capped chickadees, or the great-horned owl.</li>

            <li>Geologists studying the park’s rock formations have discovered fossilized remains indicating that the area was once a dense, swampy forest of shallow water-loving sequoia, bald cypress, and magnolia trees. Volcanoes erupting in South Dakota, Montana, and Idaho deposited ash in the area transforming the landscape into the clay, sandstone, and siltstone layers seen today. </li>

            <li>Need proof that the barren, dry Badlands was once a humid swamp? Then head to one of the wild areas of the park and hike the remote Petrified Forest Loop. The stumps and petrified logs can be found on a trail 1.5 miles from the parking lot. The entire loop covers 10.4 miles.</li>

        <h3>Grand Canyon National Park</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Grand Canyon is bigger than the state of Rhode Island</strong>. The Grand Canyon is a mile deep, 277 miles long and 18 miles wide. While the park doesn’t include the entire canyon, it does measure in at a whopping 1,904 square miles in total. In comparison, Rhode Island is around 1,212 square miles.</li>

            <li>The Grand Canyon itself can influence the weather. The Grand Canyon has an elevation spanning from around 2,000 feet to over 8,000 feet, allowing it to experience a variety of weather conditions. As a result, the temperature generally increases by 5.5 degrees with each 1,000-feet loss in elevation</li>

            <li>Hidden caves abound in the canyon. Tucked within the Grand Canyon are an estimated 1,000 caves, and of those, 335 have been recorded. Even fewer have been mapped or inventoried. Today, only one cave is open to the public -- the Cave of the Domes on Horseshoe Mesa.</li>

            <li>The Grand Canyon was carved over some 6 million years. Geological activity and erosion by the Colorado River created the Grand Canyon as we know it today. It is one of the most studied landscapes in the world, with extensive fossil records, a multitude of geologic features and rich archeological history. Learn more about the history of the Grand Canyon.</li>

            <li>The most dangerous animal in the park is the rock squirrel. From bighorn sheep and the California Condors to the Gila monster, the Grand Canyon is home to a large array of wildlife. But it’s the rock squirrel that causes the most trouble. Every year, dozens of visitors are bitten when they try to feed these animals. To stay safe, do not approach or feed any animals found at Grand Canyon (or any park). Learn more about keeping wildlife wild.</li>
