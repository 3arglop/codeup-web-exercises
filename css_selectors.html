        <h1 class="fancy-header">'Priceless' wedding ring lost at the State Fair of Texas -- and then recovered</h1>
        <p class="">They have a saying in the lost and found at the State Fair of Texas. “If you can bring it to the fair, you can lose it at the fair,” said Linda Kindt, who manages the fair’s safety team. They don’t just mean clothing, wallets or the nearly 300 cellphones they’ve collected this year. “We had a prosthetic leg,” Kindt said. “We had a set of dentures." It’s possible, though, that nothing more valuable or priceless has arrived in the lost and found office than what was found and recovered this year. Marcie Moore and her husband were headed home to Edmond, Oklahoma, just north of Oklahoma City, when she realized she wasn’t wearing her wedding ring worth thousands of dollars.</p>

        <p>It's easy to sell Halloween to young children and adults. The little ones get to trick-or-treat, and the adults get to drink at slutty themed parties. But there's one demographic that's harder to impress — generally always, but especially with a holiday centered on candy, ghouls and pumpkins. When entering a dirty, dark maze full of overly grabby actors loses its luster, what’s an adolescent Halloween fan to do? North Texas offers a variety of prime, teen-approved activities that’ll satisfy every level of scare. Here are the best local Halloween events guaranteed to get kids of all ages into the spirit of the season.</p>

        <h1 class="fancy-header">Phase one complete of southern Dallas park</h1>
        <p>TxDOT has now completed the deck over Interstate 35 that is now the foundation of Southern Gateway Park. The deck creates a bridge over I-35 East at Ewing Avenue reconnecting historic Oak Cliff. The goal is to transform the concrete bridge over I-35 into five acres of greenspace that will create, as it's been dubbed, a front yard for Dallas. Leaders plan for it to all be done in just two years. </p>
